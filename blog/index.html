<p>Drupal 8 core offers an alternative to cookie based authentication, which is HTTP Basic Auth. In this video, I show you how to use Basic Auth, touch on the security concern of using Basic Auth over plain HTTP, and talk a little bit about other authentication...</p><a href="/blog/2014/01/27/basic-authentication-drupal-8-rest/">more &raquo;</a><h2><a href="/blog/2014/01/24/delete-requests-cookie-authentication-drupal-8-rest/">Video: DELETE requests and Cookie Authentication in Drupal 8's REST</a> </h2><span>Jan 24</span>
<p>You can remove content from your site using the HTTP method DELETE. Since you don't want just anyone deleting content from your site, you'll want to keep permission limited to trusted users.

<p>With Drupal 8, you can provide REST services to interact with your site’s data, and you don’t have to rely on contrib modules to do it. This screencast is the first in a series demonstrating how to configure such services.

<p>As many in the Drupal community know, I have been heavily involved in the work around RDFa and microdata in Drupal for the past four years. What is generally less well known, though I've discussed it openly, are my thoughts on RDFa in Drupal core.</p><a href="/blog/2013/12/08/drop-rdfa-drupal-8/">more &raquo;</a><h2><a href="/blog/2013/11/26/quickstart-testing-with-behat-mink-selenium/">Video: Quickstart to testing with Behat, Mink, and Selenium</a> </h2><span>Nov 26</span>
<p>It is easy to test your website's functionality using Behat, a PHP framework for BDD (behavior driven development). This video quickly goes through the configuration of Behat, Mink, and Selenium.</p>

<p>You may have seen the announcement last week that Dries <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1784234#comment-7612081">approved</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/commitlog/commit/2/36975492e9222753eba723cd5e07da1de1bb9ab1">committed</a> a patch which changes Drupal core's default RDF mappings. When any new Drupal 8 site is installed, the markup will include RDFa that uses terms from the <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> vocabulary. Of course, as with anything Schema.org, this announcement got some attention.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what's been getting less attention are the multiple other issues that still need to be fixed if we're really going to support RDFa (or microdata, or microformats, for that matter) in Drupal 8 and support it well.</p>

Recent developments in microdata publishing support in Views/Panels and Google Summer of Code's support for microdata publishing in contrib field formatters are helping push the Microdata module closer to release.

<p>By my rough count, there are 150 contrib projects for Drupal 7 that declare new field types as part of their central module. I've listed the projects here by their usage statistics.</p>

<p>The essence of Drupal is complex interactions between modules. These interactions currently take the form of hooks. The most difficult (and most useful) thing for a Drupal developer to understand is how different sets of modules interact using these hooks and in which order.</p><p>Even though they are the heart of our system, we don&#39;t have a good way of documenting these interactions. While the API docs do contain this information for some hooks (eg, <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21node%21node.api.php/function/hook_node_load/7">hook_node_load</a>), it&#39;s hard to grasp the overall picture from reading docblocks.</p><p>This causes a bigger problem than just the learning curve. It also makes it harder for us to discuss changes in APIs and architecture. We have been seeing this in the Drupal 8 development cycle&mdash;we are considering major overhauls of systems, and it&#39;s unclear to many what the impacts of these decisions are. The only people who can intelligently participate are those who are intensely involved in the architecting process or those who take a considerable amount of time to step through the code. As sun points out in <a href="http://www.unleashedmind.com/en/blog/sun/drupal-8-the-path-forward">Drupal 8: The Path Forward</a>, this communication challenge remains unresolved.</p><p>We need to find a way to communicate about these interactions which are so central to what we do.&nbsp;I have recently starting working with a visualization technique that helps me understand these interactions better, and I would be interested to hear whether others find it helpful as well.</p>

<p>I posted this video a couple of weeks ago but didn't get a chance to write it up. It demonstrates building a module that creates a view using SPARQL on whatever site it is installed on.</p>
<p>If you provide a dataset and it is available with SPARQL, this can be a really great way to help people understand how to use your data. Because users who install the module can use the Views user interface to alter the view that is created, it can be a great starting point for experimentation by users who don't know so much about your data or building views.</p>
