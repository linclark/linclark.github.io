  <h1>(sioc)Users are (foaf)People too</h1>
  <p>The statement above is not actually true, sioc:User (now called sioc:UserAccount) and foaf:Person are related to each other, but not the same thing. </p>

<p>I think most SemWeb and Linked Data people would wholeheartedly agree with this modeling, and when you think about it, it does make sense. A person can have multiple user accounts, or multiple people can share one user account. So it does actually represent the real world pretty well... but lately, I’ve started wondering whether it is worth the cost. The problem is, most Drupal site admins aren’t thinking too hard about what a user really is.</p>
<p>For example, Drupal has users, which are modeled as a sioc:UserAccount. And for years we’ve had this neat field in Drupal called User Reference, which can be used to make a connection between a node and a user. For example, let’s say you have a company Web site which needs to <a href="http://gotdrupal.com/videos/drupal-views-relationships">list departments and their employees</a>. You want to create a connection between the department and it’s employees, so you would use a User Reference field on the department.</p>

<p>… And did you see what just happened there? We just conflated the user and the person. </p>

<p>It isn’t just in Drupal site administration where we do this. For example, I collaborate with Stéphane Corlosquet on code on drupal.org, where he goes by scor. I often say things like “scor hosted an RDF code sprint”, or that “Stéphane just posted an issue”. If I were being totally accurate, the subjects of those two sentences wouldn’t be interchangeable... but in my mind, they are.</p>

<p>It is easy to insert the user when you have a birds-eye perspective over an existing system, such as when you are building extractors for social networking sites. However, in the case where we are building more complex and dynamic networks of assertions, it doesn’t map well to the way we think. This is even more true when you consider the average site admin, uninitiated in the role modeling ways of the SemWeb community.</p>

<h2>The larger question</h2>

<p>I think this highlights a question with RDF vocabularies in general... should they try to represent the world as it is, or be closer to the world of our casual perception and the fuzzy way we communicate about things in real life. This is the difference between proscribing how people should see the world, and describing how they do see the world.</p>

<p>With these vocabularies, what we’re really creating is a dictionary for Web developers to describe data relationships. To achieve the ends of the Linked Data effort, we need this dictionary to be widely adopted. For this, we need to reduce the lexicographic information costs—the amount of effort it takes for someone to assimilate our dictionary into their conception of the world and into everyday usage.</p>

<p>The thing that really attracted me to the work that Stéphane was doing in Drupal with RDF CCK, and what really motivated me to get involved in this work, was that it integrated with a workflow that was already in use by hundreds of thousands of site admins. It was an integration that took a concept the site admin was already familiar with, entities with fields, and extended it to describe resources and properties. It was unobtrusive, it didn’t change the existing user interaction but just added a tiny supplement. </p>

<p>In contrast, if we tell site admins that there are now two different concepts (user and person) where there was once one, and it’s up to them to figure out how to disentangle which fields belong to the user and which fields belong to the person, the technology we have introduced starts to become obtrusive.</p>

<h2>What do you think?</h2>

<p>Kjetil Kjernsmo pointed out the <a href="http://sioc-project.org/node/134">complexity of the user/person distinction</a> in an email to the SIOC-dev list a while back and there have been other <a href="http://danbri.org/words/2010/01/14/549">related</a> <a href="http://sioc-project.org/node/235">discussions</a> as well. The SIOC team has been open to feedback like this and has tried to make the vocabulary as easy to use as possible. </p>

<p>That’s why I’m wondering whether others who are building applications find the same thing that I have and that Kjetil references. Have others found the user/person distinction complicates things? Are there particular, implemented use cases where this added abstraction is useful? How can Drupal deal with this added complexity in the site admin’s interaction?</p>

<aside>Note: I should note that I was one of the people pushing for the establishment of a separate foaf:Person resource with it’s own URI during the later part of the RDF Mapping API development cycle... it’s one of those things that makes a lot of sense when you’re modeling that maybe doesn’t make so much sense when you’re actually interacting with a system in a real life situation.</aside>
