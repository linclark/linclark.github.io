  <h1>The two meanings of semantics in HTML5</h1>
  <p>There is a lot of confusion around HTML5 and RDFa, both in the Drupal community and outside of it. That&rsquo;s why I decided to <a href="http://lin-clark.com/blog/theming-html5-and-rdfa-drupal-7">redevelop my site in Drupal 7 with HTML5</a>, using a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme">base theme</a> available on Drupal.org, to see for myself what it's like using HTML5 and RDFa together.</p><p>HTML5 is the incontestable future of the Web, and it is becoming more and more clear that inline structured data is also going to be a fundamental part of the future Web... and, with the <a href="http://buytaert.net/semantic-web-and-drupal-video">current core support for RDFa</a> and the <a href="http://buytaert.net/html5-in-drupal-8">future core support for HTML5</a>, Drupal has an interest in both.</p>
<p>The capabilities offered by HTML5&mdash;and the other standards that sometimes get conflated with it, such as CSS3&mdash;blow my mind.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also been impressed by a number of the people involved in developing and evangelizing HTML5, particularly the emphasis I&rsquo;ve seen on the social aspects of standards adoption/compliance and the concern for the cognitive load placed on the developer. I didn&rsquo;t know much about that side until <a href="http://drupalradar.com/video-jeremy-keith-keynote-session">Jeremy Keith talked about design priorities</a> at DrupalCon Copenhagen... you should watch that.</p>
<h2>What more could you ask for?</h2>
<p>In spite of this HTML awesomeness, there are still some things that HTML just doesn&rsquo;t do... at least, not without a little help. What I want that plain old HTML doesn&rsquo;t give me</p><ol><li>I want add content to one site and then be able to target specific pieces of that content to display on another site...</li><li>using whatever platform I want as my backend for those sites (or even no platform at all)...</li><li>without having to worry when I change the document structure of the source site (like removing <code>classes</code> or adding more <code>divs</code>) that I might break things in applications other people have built...</li><li>and if one thing or person is talked about on multiple sites, I want to be able to retrieve and remix information from all of those sites without having to hand-edit the files to align them.</li></ol><p>And I want to do all this without having to learn any proprietary APIs (ie, the Twitter API, the Flickr API, the GoodReads API, etc, etc, etc), without having to feed my data into Google's giant data pools, and without having to code custom tools for each set of data.</p><p>You can&rsquo;t do all of this at the same time just using plain old HTML... however, you can when you add place a few machine-readable labels on your content. You&rsquo;ve added <i><b>semantics</b></i> to your data and opened it up for reuse. Now applications can come to your site and use the HTML page like a database.</p><p>But wait, isn&rsquo;t HTML5 all about semantics, too? <h2>The difference between HTML semantics and the other kind of semantics</h2><p>At DrupalCon, questions always come up about HTML5&rsquo;s semantic markup vs. RDFa. As I always try to explain, it isn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;versus&rsquo; kind of situation.</p><p>The trouble is the word semantics. The word means &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;. Unfortunately, in the way it is used, its own meaning is often unclear.</p><p>HTML5 adds a whole bunch of new semantic elements. These are meant to help browsers understand how to present your content better, whether it is being presented on a screen or by some other kind of device, such as a screenreader. Example elements are video, nav for menus, and mark for highlighted text.</p><p><em>That is the meaning of your <strong>document structure</strong>, not the meaning of your <strong>content itself</strong>.</em></p><p>For instance, say I have two articles, one about Ireland and the other about the Blue Heron that wanders around my house. And let&rsquo;s say I have an aside within each article.</p><figure><figcaption>Two imaginary HTML pages</figcaption><br /><img src="/images/blog/post-semantics_in_html5-pages.png" width=540 /></figure><p>For the Ireland article, the aside will contain information about Ireland, such as the gross domestic product (GDP), broken down by sector. For the article about the blue heron, the aside will contain information about blue herons, such as its species name and links to other herons in the same genus.</p><p>The semantics of the document structure of the two pages is the same, an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> with an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>.</p><figure><figcaption>Structure of the document: <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> with an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></figcaption><br /><img src="/images/blog/post-semantics_in_html5-html_semantics.png" width=540 /></figure><p>However, the semantics of the content are different. While the relationship between the subjects and their images is the same, the relationship between a country and its GDP is different than the relationship between an animal and its species name.</p><figure><figcaption>Structure of the content: Ireland-&gt;GDP; Heron-&gt;species</figcaption><br /><img src="/images/blog/post-semantics_in_html5-content_semantics.png" width=540 /></figure><p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that the language for describing these two different kinds of semantics is so fuzzy. It is quite easy to understand why people confuse semantic HTML markup and semantically marked-up content. But the distinction is important to any discussion about HTML and RDFa. As a layer of extra meaning on top of HTML, RDFa is comparable to microdata, another W3C working draft, in the way it allows developers to add structure to data.</p><p>Before leaving this example, I would just like to note that because both the GDP information and the species information are available in RDF datasets that have SPARQL endpoints to access that RDF, you could actually pull all of the content for the aside directly from the source using a tool like SPARQL Views, which means you don&rsquo;t have to enter and maintain the info yourself :)</p><h2>The real discussion: microdata and RDFa</h2><p>Like RDFa, microdata is a way of adding structure to your data within the markup, and does it in a more generalized way than microformats (at least, the original microformats).</p><aside class="sidenote"><h3>Some progress, though...</h3><p>I originally wrote this post in mid-May, but shelved it for a while in light of contemporaneous events. Since I wrote this, discussion of the two seems to be focusing more on the technical similarities and differences and engaging in productive discourse about them... which is an all-around good thing for the web.</p></aside><p>In the talk I gave at DrupalCon Chicago, I mentioned that sometimes when people ask me about microdata and RDFa, it&rsquo;s in these slightly hushed, excited tones... as though they were asking me about a fight at the prom last night. And it is really a shame that this is the case.</p><p>It seems like a lot of the reason for past animosity between the supporters of the two specs is political and philosophical, not so much technical. The truth is microdata and RDFa are similar in a number of ways. There are many people like myself who just want to do cool things with data and need an easy way to extract data from a page and sometimes combine it with data from other sites, and for these people, both specs move us further than we are today.</p><p>But there are some real differences between the two specs. As a community, I think we need to engage with these differences and really try these things out... because at this point in time, while the standards clearly state the need for implementation feedback, we can still file bug reports and have the standardizers welcome them.</p><h3>To learn more</h3><p>There are others who have written about microdata and RDFa, and some have examined the differences. These are some of the ones that I like, please add any other recommendations in the comments:</p><ul><li>Chrome Web standards hacker and active #whatwg participant <b>Tab Atkins</b> has a good <a href="http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b4570">introduction to microdata</a></li><li><b>Manu Sporny</b>, chair of the W3C's RDFa working group, provided a very helpful <a href="http://manu.sporny.org/2011/uber-comparison-rdfa-md-uf/">comparison of RDFa, microdata, and microformats</a>.</li><li><b>Jeni Tennison</b>, a very insightful developer who&rsquo;s worked on big Linked Data projects, has given her <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/taxonomy/term/44">comments in multiple posts.</a></li><li><b>Benjamin Nowack</b>, developer of the ARC2 RDF library for PHP that we use in Drupal, has <a href="http://bnode.org/blog/tag/microdata">talked about microdata</a> as semantic markup for both RDFers and non-RDFers</li></ul></aside><aside class="warning"><h2>Before you comment</h2><p>I think that Drupal can play an active part in giving standardizers necessary feedback—we are a large community of active Web publishers who already understand some of the ways structured data is useful (because really, that's what a content type is... and we <3 our nodes).</p><p>If we're going to give good feedback, though, we need to be sure it is based on real-life experience, not on polemics. If you have implementation experience, I'd love to hear about it.</p><p>Please let me know if I could articulate something better or if there is a technical detail I'm missing. Please no &ldquo;X is double thumbs up, Y is teh suxors,&rdquo; that doesn't help anybody.</p></aside>
