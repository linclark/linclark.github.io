<p>You may have seen the announcement last week that Dries <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1784234#comment-7612081">approved</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/commitlog/commit/2/36975492e9222753eba723cd5e07da1de1bb9ab1">committed</a> a patch which changes Drupal core's default RDF mappings. When any new Drupal 8 site is installed, the markup will include RDFa that uses terms from the <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> vocabulary. Of course, as with anything Schema.org, this announcement got some attention.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what's been getting less attention are the multiple other issues that still need to be fixed if we're really going to support RDFa (or microdata, or microformats, for that matter) in Drupal 8 and support it well.</p>

Recent developments in microdata publishing support in Views/Panels and Google Summer of Code's support for microdata publishing in contrib field formatters are helping push the Microdata module closer to release.

<p>The essence of Drupal is complex interactions between modules. These interactions currently take the form of hooks. The most difficult (and most useful) thing for a Drupal developer to understand is how different sets of modules interact using these hooks and in which order.</p><p>Even though they are the heart of our system, we don&#39;t have a good way of documenting these interactions. While the API docs do contain this information for some hooks (eg, <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21node%21node.api.php/function/hook_node_load/7">hook_node_load</a>), it&#39;s hard to grasp the overall picture from reading docblocks.</p><p>This causes a bigger problem than just the learning curve. It also makes it harder for us to discuss changes in APIs and architecture. We have been seeing this in the Drupal 8 development cycle&mdash;we are considering major overhauls of systems, and it&#39;s unclear to many what the impacts of these decisions are. The only people who can intelligently participate are those who are intensely involved in the architecting process or those who take a considerable amount of time to step through the code. As sun points out in <a href="http://www.unleashedmind.com/en/blog/sun/drupal-8-the-path-forward">Drupal 8: The Path Forward</a>, this communication challenge remains unresolved.</p><p>We need to find a way to communicate about these interactions which are so central to what we do.&nbsp;I have recently starting working with a visualization technique that helps me understand these interactions better, and I would be interested to hear whether others find it helpful as well.</p>

<p>On June 2, the big three search engines (Google, Yahoo, and Bing) announced Schema.org, which helps them show search results in a more useful way. The <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2011/07/on-june-2-nd-we-announced-collaboration.html">announcement</a> has gotten people really interested in inline structured data such as microdata and RDFa.</p>
<p>This screencast shows how you can use the microdata module to place Schema.org terms. This is an early preview—very few field formatters have microdata support at this time and the module is still changing quite a bit—but I thought people might be interested in the direction the module is heading.</p>

<p>I posted this video a couple of weeks ago but didn't get a chance to write it up. It demonstrates building a module that creates a view using SPARQL on whatever site it is installed on.</p>
<p>If you provide a dataset and it is available with SPARQL, this can be a really great way to help people understand how to use your data. Because users who install the module can use the Views user interface to alter the view that is created, it can be a great starting point for experimentation by users who don't know so much about your data or building views.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been quite a row about a tweet sent out by the DrupalCon Twitter account. The tweet suggested that people look at the attendees page to reconnect with the attractive developer/designer they met at last year's DrupalCon. A number of people pointed out that this subtly (though inadvertently) promotes a sexually charged environment at the conference.</p><p>For the most part I have stayed out of the discussion, but in catching up on some blog posts last night I saw some troubling reactions, with people being quite callous to the experiences of those who found the tweet off-putting.</p>
<p>I don't usually blog about these kinds of issues, but I wanted to share some of my experiences that I think can help inform the discussion and help people understand some of the sensitivities.</p>
<p>Not all of these experiences are directly related to the tweet at hand, but I do believe the "Drupal isn't immune" section does directly relate and is a very concrete example of how women can sometimes be treated at these events.</p>

<p>Interest in microdata has been on the rise since the <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html">schema.org announcement</a> in June.</p><p>I had fortunately already been looking at the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html">microdata spec</a> and thinking about how the work to get RDFa output in core could be repurposed for microdata, so I <a href="http://drupal.org/project/microdata">started a project</a> that day.</p>
<p>Since microdata is based on RDFa, there is a lot that can be repurposed. But as I noted in <a href="http://lin-clark.com/blog/two-meanings-semantics-html5">my last post on the subject</a>, there are also small differences between the specs... and in some cases, these small differences have a big impact.</p>

<p>There are a lot of data providers who publish their data openly for reuse. Surprisingly, <a href="http://ckan.net/package/cia-world-factbook">the CIA is one</a> of them.</p>
<p>Because of this, data geeks can take it and turn it into something that's easy for others to reuse, using open data formats. And because it's available in an open data format, platforms like <a href="http://beta.kasabi.com">Kasabi</a> can load it on to their big servers and provide ways for other sites to access and query it, like a SPARQL endpoint. And because it is provided in a SPARQL endpoint, it is easy to reuse it in your Drupal site using Views.</p>

However, this is <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1057386">not so easy with git.</a></p><p>Before starting, I asked in #drupal-contribute whether pulling all of contrib for research purposes would be frowned upon, since it can really soak up a lot of server resources.

<p>I'm a big fan of inline structured data like RDFa because it makes it easy to share information between sites. For example, if my research institute listed my speaking appearances with RDFa, I could just use Views to display those presentations on my site. Instead of getting the list from my MySQL database, Views would use the external Web page as its "database".</p>

<p>I'm also a big fan of HTML5. It is a big step towards a more exciting, more usable, and more developer friendly Web. </p>

<p>Drupal has made commitments to both, with its support for RDFa in core in Drupal 7 and its move towards HTML 5 output in Drupal 8. That's why I wanted to give the RDFa and HTML 5 compatibility a test drive, starting with my own site.</p>

<p>The first of these is how to contribute to projects on drupal.org. The best way to get started with contrib is by making small fixes to other people's projects.

<p>The statement above is not actually true, sioc:User (now called sioc:UserAccount) and foaf:Person are related to each other, but not the same thing. </p>

<p>I think most SemWeb and Linked Data people would wholeheartedly agree with this modeling, and when you think about it, it does make sense. A person can have multiple user accounts, or multiple people can share one user account. So it does actually represent the real world pretty well... but lately, I’ve started wondering whether it is worth the cost. The problem is, most Drupal site admins aren’t thinking too hard about what a user really is.</p>

<p>While working on code for Drupal 7, I've been creating and dropping databases all over the place. And each time I drop a database, I have to go to my browser and fill out all the site information again.</p>
<p>So this got me thinking... does it really need to be this way? (Spoiler: it doesn't)</p>
<p> A few weeks ago I found Byte Craft kamal's <a href="http://blog.bytecraft.com.my/blog/kamal/2009/12/08/installing-drupal-command-line">awesome post about twill</a>, a really simple language that lets you fill out HTML forms from the command line, and how it can be used to install your Drupal site without using your browser at all!</p>
<p>In this post, I will expand that solution to show you how you can create scripts to download and install Drupal and then show you a script you can use to automate the recreation of your site when you drop the database.</p>

<p>What if you could find all of the academics working in your field across all universities in the world with a simple, SQL-like query? What if you could filter your search based on the region the academics are working in, the projects they have worked on, the languages they speak and then get a list of the courses that they offer? All with one query.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I totally geek out over that prospect.</p>
